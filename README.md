All of my projects in one place.

### Kaggle
##### (Most recent - go here first!)

Used Kaggle's [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition to demonstrate my approach to a routine data science task. The focus is less on applying advanced modelling techniques and more about the thinking behind maximizing data science delivery while adapting to risk and business realities.



### Other projects:
##### _Tetris puzzle_
An implementation of the puzzle game [IQ Puzzler Pro](https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/iq-puzzler-pro). 2D version only.
Not meant to be human-playable. Instead, intended as an environment for testing various algorithms for solving the game.

Planned development:
1. - [X] Implementation on CLI
2. - [X] Heuristic solver
3. - [ ] Mixed-integer programming solver
4. - [ ] GUI


##### _Pirate passage_
An implementation of the [Pirate Passage](https://www.lumosity.com/app/v4/games/pirate-passage) game on Luminosity.
Not meant to be human-playable. Instead, intended as an environment for testing various algorithms for solving the game.

Planned development:
1. - [X] Base game as CLI
2. - [ ] Base game as GUI
3. - [ ] Dynamic programming solver
4. - [ ] Reinforcement learning solver
